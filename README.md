#Some Worlds regarding Diploma thesis

This was small part of gigantic project that was related with smart home and IOT services.
The team that designed this had to give a solution to the following problem:

"Assuiming we have a home or a building in general, we want to have infomration about the building/home/office contitions
regarding temperature for example and at the same time to monitoring the devices contition which are giving these mesurements.
Moreover we want to know if something goes wrong either to the sensor network (low sensor battery) or in the building(ex Fire)."

The team had all the Sensor network deployed in lab contitions and had all the data available in RAW text file.

The chalenge of this diploma Thesis was to depoly a derive that separates the mesurements of the building contitions from sensor network 
contition and in the second level track abnormalities in both data.
We ideal was to issue an notification about any related abnormal situation that will be discovered.


#Conclusions

The general conclusion after all implementation was that the final goal of the project was unable to accomplished and include untreten factors because of the lack of
location information. In other words if something goes wrong and we have no uncertainty we will not be able to trace the problem unless is something obvious.
